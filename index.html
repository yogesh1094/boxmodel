                    It’s the next big breakthrough in technology. It’s a joke. It’s a marketing strategy. It’s a
                    techno-dystopian nightmare. It’s the <b>metaverse</b> — defined most simply as a virtual world where
                    people
                    can socialize, work, and play — and Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes it is the future of the
                    internet and of his trillion-dollar company.Although “metaverse” became a buzzword after Facebook
                    changed its company name to <strong><em>“Meta”</em></strong> last month, many people are still trying to understand
                    what
                    exactly the metaverse is and whether the futuristic technological concept is something they should
                    take seriously. Many critics and skeptics have mocked Zuckerberg’s plan to change Facebook from a
                    social media company to a metaverse company. Some critics say that by focusing on the metaverse and
                    renaming itself while the company is reeling from a PR crisis, Facebook is distracting from the
                    problems it creates or contributes to in the real world: issues like harming teens’ mental health,
                    facilitating the spread of disinformation, and fueling political polarization.
